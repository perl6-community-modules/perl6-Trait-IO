# NAME

Trait::IO - Helper IO traits

# SYNOPSIS

```perl6
    use Trait::IO;

    for <a b c> {
        my $fh does auto-close = .IO.open: :w;
        # ... do things with the file handle
        # $fh is auto-closed on block leave
    }
```

# DESCRIPTION

Useful traits for working with Perl 6 IO.

# EXPORTS

## `does` `auto-close`

    my $fh does auto-close = "foo".IO.open: :w;

Installs a `LEAVE` phaser to automatically close the file handle when scope
is left.

Exports the `auto-close` constant and the `trait_mod:<does>` multi that
accepts it as a value.

Currently works only with variables and not with attributes or parameters.
Patches welcome.
